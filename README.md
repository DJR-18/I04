## Aim
The project aims to develop a robotic arm, in simulation, with an objective of pick and
place mechanism. Weâ€™ll mainly simulate the workspace,forward  kinematics and inverse
kinematics of the arm on MATLAB. If time permits, this can further be programmed to
segregate objects based on shape, size and color and then such bots can be used in
warehouses.
## Introduction
A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions
to a human arm. A robotic arm can be used for automating various tasks which reduces
human effort which in turn will increase productivity.
